               <br> What is a programming language? <br/>
                <p>A programming language is a distinct language that identifies instructions that can assemble any output a person wants it to.
                These languages usually contain instructions for a computer. Most times, algorithms are implemented, to properly run the programs.
                Three programming languages that will be covered here are C++, Java, and Ruby.</p>
                
                
                <br> History <br/>
                <p>Some early history on computer programming was contributed by Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing, Alonzo Church, John von Neumann
                and many others. These people were either mathmeticians, physicists, or scientists that helped start one of the first computer
                programs. It wasn't until the 1950's that the first programming languages were developed to communicate instructions to computers.
                The language was called Plankalkul (Plan Calculus), designed 1943 - 1945 by German civil engineer, Konrad Zuse. However, the
                language was not implemented until 2000.</p>
